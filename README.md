# Which Web Framework is Faster?
> Basic out of the box Web frameworks performance comparison

There are numerous of **backend web frameworks** for different programming languages. Each of them comes with its own advantages and drawbacks. And it is not a simple task to answer the question "Which framework is the best?". But we can looks at the topic from different perspectives. And **performance** is a simple metric (yet just one of many) that is measurable and gives an answer to "which framework is faster/fastest?"

The purpose of this project is to attempt to measure a performance of different web stacks as they come out of the box, with no code added.
